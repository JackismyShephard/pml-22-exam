quantitative measure of goodness

    log prob on mnist test set 
        measure log prob for each test set sample given a specific value of z
        take the average over all log probs for a given z as well as over all samples from the test set
        
        for sklearn gmm:
            score_p = model.score(X,y)
            
            loglikelihood = mean ( score_p, forall X in test set)
            
        alternative for torch.distributions
            for a given sample x:
                temp = 0
                for each z:
                    get mu_z and cov_z

                    p = get multivariateNormal(mu_z, cov_z)

                    temp += p.log_prob(x)
                
            average over all samples x in test set


qualititive measure of goodness

    sampling x conditioning on z
        for each z
            sample x~p(x|z) (could also sample multiple and take average)

            reshape from 784-dim value to nice image (28x 28)

            plot
        
        note:
            a visual measure of the models correspondance with actual mnist data
